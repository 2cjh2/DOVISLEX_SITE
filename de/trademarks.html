                        <h1>Intellectual property</h1>

                        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L14">Since 2000 the Firm is also active in the field of intellectual property. It is possible to register a EU Trademark through an application to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) in Alicante, Spain. </p>
                        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L15">The European Trademark, if granted, covers all 28 countries of the European Union for a period of 10 years, and may be renewed. Hence, it is advantageous over applying for a trademark with each individual country (with the associated costs).</p>
                        <p class="LcustomTranslation" id="L16"> The European mark confers to its holder protections against reproduction or imitation of its brand throughout the European Union; more specifically, the right to prohibit a third party from using, without his consent,  signs identical or similar to those covered by the trademark (under certain conditions, this right is also extended to products or services other than those for which the trademark is registered).</p>
                        <p> Under certain circumstances, these actions are possible:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>oppose the application by others for registration of a European trademark;</li>
                            <li class="LcustomTranslationLI" id="L17">initiate an action of invalidity for a trademark already granted to another entity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p></p>
